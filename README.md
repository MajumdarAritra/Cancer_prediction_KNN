# Cancer_prediction_KNN<br>
# Overview<br>
The Cancer Prediction project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the presence of cancer based on various features extracted from medical data. This machine learning model is designed to classify data into benign or malignant categories with high accuracy.<br>

# Features
Predict cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) using the KNN algorithm.<br>
Data preprocessing including feature scaling and encoding.<br>
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.<br>
Easy-to-use interface for making predictions.
